# Course 3 (Robot Dynamics) Project

## Contents
- `code` is where all code is located. `project.py` implements a class for
running UR5 robotic arm dynamic simulations assuming no joint torques,
friction, or external forces, just gravity.
- `simulation*.csv` files are created by `project.py`. They contain the joint
values for each iteration of the simulation.
- `simulation*.avi` are videos of the simulations run in CoppeliaSim.
